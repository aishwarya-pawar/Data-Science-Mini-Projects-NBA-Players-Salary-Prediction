# NBA-Players-Salary-Prediction
Predicting NBA Player's salary using various machine learning algorithms like linear regression (Ridge, Lasso,PCA,PCR), Random Forest, Bagging, Boosting and Neural Networks using R 

## Project Title:

NBA (National Basketball Association) Player's Salary Prediction

## Motivation:
At the beginning of each season, when the salaries of pro athletes are publicized, we're always left wondering: How much each player is making? 
Let's use our machine learning skills to come to decide the driving factors to determine player's salary. 
Here, I am using various models to compare their accuracy to solve this a bit complex problem
